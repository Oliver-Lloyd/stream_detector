# Stream Detector

Quick little template script that automatically checks whether or not a specified Twitch stream is live. If it is live, the script will open the stream mute the browser.

Currently requires Chrome to be installed and be the default windows browser, but that could easily be changed.

This script should most definitely *not be run constantly on your computer to automatically collect drops on streams* such as, for instance, twitch.tv/rocketleague.
