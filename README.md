# Stream Detector

Quick little template script that automatically checks whether or not a specified Twitch stream is live. If it goes live, the script will open the stream and mute the browser containing it.

This script should most definitely *not be run constantly on your computer to automatically collect drops on streams* such as, for instance, twitch.tv/rocketleague. 

Currently requires Chrome to be installed and be the default windows browser, but that could easily be changed.
